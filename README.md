## Goals/Intent of Development
  1. The primary goal is to create a graph database that is a reflection of recent MLB players. The database itself with hold a range of relationships between players and their teams and players and their stats/information. 
  2. The graph structure would allow for some interesting query types. Consider the following queries:
     a. "How are Player A and Player B connected by teammates?"
     b. "Which players have shared multiple teams and seasons together?"
     c. "Show the ordered path of teams for a player and show other players who have followed the same development."
